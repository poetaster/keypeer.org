# Api prototyping update

We're currently a bit stalled while testing a Go backend and remodelling the api. So far we've been using the Swagger editor to produce and openapi 3.0.0 api.

While [mocking](https://api.keypeer.org/v1.0/) the ui path is offline as we test.

If you have suggestions please leave us a todo in the [issue queue](https://github.com/poetaster/keypeer.org/issues).
