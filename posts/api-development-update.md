# Api prototyping update

We're currently a bit stalled while considering what backend to use. So far we've been using the Swagger editor to produce and openapi 3.0.0 api.

While [mocking](https://api.keypeer.org/v1.0/ui) with python (flask) is fairly quick to do, the Swagger io editor produces somewhat opinionated code.

For someone with experience with Flask and Werkzeug, it's not really 'the way'. I'm considering building this in scala. 

If you have suggestions please leave us a todo in the [issue queue](https://github.com/poetaster/keypeer.org/issues).
